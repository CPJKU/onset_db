onset_db
========

This data set includes onset annotations which can be used for the evaluation of
onset detection algorithms. It does not include the audio files. Some can be
found at <http://mir.minimoog.org/sb-mir-db.zip>, all remaining must be obtained

`.onsets` contain the onset annotations, one per line, given in seconds.
The `original` branch includes the original annotations, the `master` branch the
modified onsets.
