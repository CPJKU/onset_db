onset_db
========

This data set includes onset annotations which can be used for the evaluation of
onset detection algorithms. It does not include the audio files. If no download
link is given below, the data must be obtained by the original author.

`.onsets` contain the onset annotations, one per line, given in seconds.
The `original` branch includes the original annotations, the `master` branch the
modified onsets.
